# Performance Optimization Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Excessive Console Logging
**Problem**: The app was logging extensively, especially in the transformation and realtime services, causing performance degradation.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped all console.log statements with `if (__DEV__)` checks
- Created a `perfLog` utility function in `apiTransformers.ts` that only logs in development
- Reduced logging in polling client and realtime services

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/apiTransformers.ts` - Replaced console.log with perfLog
- `src/sdk/pollingClient.ts` - Added __DEV__ checks
- `src/services/realtimeService.ts` - Added __DEV__ checks

### 2. Polling Frequency
**Problem**: The app was polling every 10 seconds, causing unnecessary network requests and battery drain.

**Solution**: 
- Keep the 10-second polling interval but optimize the polling logic
- Reduce console logging during polling
- Only process changes, not all data

**Recommendation**: Consider increasing to 15-20 seconds if performance is still an issue.

### 3. Memory Leaks from Intervals
**Problem**: Multiple intervals and timers throughout the app that might not be properly cleaned up.

**Identified Intervals**:
- OrderProvider: 30-second refresh interval (properly cleaned)
- RealtimeService/PollingClient: 10-second polling (properly cleaned)
- LocationService: Permission check and force update intervals
- IncomingOrderModal: Timer and ringing intervals
- SoundService: Ringing interval

**Solution**: All major intervals appear to have proper cleanup in place.

### 4. Re-renders and State Updates
**Problem**: Frequent state updates causing unnecessary re-renders.

**Recommendations**:
1. Use `React.memo` for heavy components like order cards
2. Implement `useMemo` for expensive calculations
3. Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components
4. Consider using Redux or Zustand for better state management

### 5. Heavy Transformations
**Problem**: The order transformation includes JSON.stringify for debugging which is expensive.

**Solution**: Removed JSON.stringify from production logging and only use it in development mode.

## Additional Performance Tips

### 1. Lazy Loading
- Implement lazy loading for screens not immediately visible
- Use React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting

### 2. Image Optimization
- Use cached images where possible
- Implement progressive loading for large images
- Consider using FastImage library

### 3. List Optimization
- Use FlatList instead of ScrollView for long lists
- Implement getItemLayout for fixed-height items
- Use keyExtractor properly
- Set appropriate windowSize and initialNumToRender

### 4. Animation Performance
- Use native driver for animations where possible
- Avoid animating layout properties (use transform instead)
- Use InteractionManager for post-animation work

### 5. Network Optimization
- Implement request caching
- Use ETags for conditional requests
- Batch API requests where possible
- Implement offline support with proper sync

## Monitoring Performance

### React Native Performance Monitor
- Shake device and enable "Show Perf Monitor"
- Watch for:
  - JS frame rate (should be 60fps)
  - UI frame rate (should be 60fps)
  - RAM usage

### Flipper Integration
- Use Flipper for detailed performance profiling
- Monitor network requests
- Check for memory leaks
- Profile React components

### Production Monitoring
- Implement crash reporting (Sentry, Bugsnag)
- Add performance monitoring
- Track key metrics:
  - App launch time
  - Screen load times
  - API response times
  - JS bundle size
