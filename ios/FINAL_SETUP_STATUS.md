# Final iOS Setup Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Real `GoogleService-Info.plist` installed from Firebase Console
   - Bundle ID updated to match Firebase: `com.murrsal.murrsal`
   - `FirebaseApp.configure()` added to AppDelegate.swift
   - React Native Firebase packages installed: `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging`

2. **CocoaPods Setup**
   - All 102 pods installed successfully
   - `use_modular_headers!` added to Podfile
   - Firebase pods properly linked

3. **Project Configuration**
   - Workspace file created: `DriverAppNew.xcworkspace`
   - firebase.json configuration file added
   - Bundle identifier synchronized with Firebase config

## ❌ Remaining Issue
**Error Code 70** persists due to iOS SDK version mismatch:
- Xcode requires iOS 18.5 platform
- Only iOS 18.4 simulators are available
- Scheme configuration appears to target iOS 18.5

## 🔧 Solution Required
**Open the project in Xcode to fix the iOS SDK target:**

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open DriverAppNew.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Fix iOS Deployment Target:**
   - Select DriverAppNew project → DriverAppNew target
   - Build Settings → iOS Deployment Target → Set to 18.4 (or lower)
   - Product → Clean Build Folder
   - Product → Build

3. **Alternative: Install iOS 18.5 SDK**
   - Xcode → Settings → Platforms
   - Download iOS 18.5 platform

## 🚀 Current Status Summary
- ✅ Firebase: Fully configured with real credentials
- ✅ Dependencies: All packages installed
- ✅ Bundle ID: Matches Firebase configuration
- ⚠️ Build Target: Needs iOS SDK version alignment

**The project is 95% ready - just needs the iOS SDK version fixed in Xcode.**

## Test Commands After Fixing
```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/admin/Documents/repo/mursal-backend/DriverAppNew

# Option 1: Use React Native CLI
npx react-native run-ios

# Option 2: Start Metro separately
npm start
# In another terminal:
npx react-native run-ios --no-packager
```
