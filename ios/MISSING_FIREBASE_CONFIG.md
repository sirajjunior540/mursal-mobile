# Missing Firebase Configuration for iOS

The iOS build is failing because the required Firebase configuration file is missing.

## Issue
The `GoogleService-Info.plist` file is not present in the iOS app directory. This file is required for Firebase services to work properly on iOS.

## Solution
1. Go to your Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your Mursal Driver App project
3. Click on the iOS app configuration
4. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
5. Add it to the iOS project:
   - Open `DriverAppNew.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Right-click on the DriverAppNew folder in the Project Navigator
   - Select "Add Files to DriverAppNew"
   - Select the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
   - Click "Add"

## Alternative: Temporary Fix
If you don't have access to the Firebase console or want to test without Firebase, you can:
1. Remove Firebase dependencies temporarily
2. Or create a dummy `GoogleService-Info.plist` file (not recommended for production)

After adding the file, run:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
cd .. && npx react-native run-ios
```
