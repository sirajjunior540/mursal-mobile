# iOS Build Error Summary

## Issue
The iOS build is failing with xcodebuild error code 70 when trying to run `npx react-native run-ios`.

## Steps Taken
1. ✅ Ran `pod install` successfully - all dependencies installed
2. ✅ Added `use_modular_headers!` to Podfile to fix Firebase Swift dependencies
3. ✅ Created dummy `GoogleService-Info.plist` file (needs real Firebase config)
4. ✅ Created `firebase.json` configuration file
5. ✅ Metro bundler is running successfully

## Current Status
- Workspace file exists: `DriverAppNew.xcworkspace`
- All pods installed successfully (102 total pods)
- Simulator is booted: iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 18.4)
- Build fails with error code 70

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Open in Xcode (Recommended)
1. Open Xcode
2. Open `DriverAppNew.xcworkspace` (NOT the .xcodeproj file)
3. Select the DriverAppNew scheme
4. Select iPhone 16 Pro simulator
5. Press Cmd+B to build
6. Check the detailed error messages in Xcode

### Option 2: Get Real Firebase Configuration
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Download the real `GoogleService-Info.plist` 
3. Replace the dummy file in `ios/DriverAppNew/`
4. Run `cd ios && pod install`
5. Try building again

### Option 3: Check Build Settings
The error code 70 often indicates:
- Missing provisioning profiles
- Code signing issues
- Missing required capabilities
- Build configuration problems

Open the project in Xcode to see the specific error details.

## Command to Run After Fixing
```bash
cd /Users/admin/Documents/repo/mursal-backend/DriverAppNew
npx react-native run-ios
```
