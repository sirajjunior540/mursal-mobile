URGENT BACKEND FIX REQUIRED
===========================

The mobile app is experiencing critical errors when declining orders.
This file contains the exact fix needed for your Django backend.

ERRORS OCCURRING:
1. "You can only decline your own assigned deliveries" - when declining from dashboard
2. "No delivery matches the query" - when declining from modal

ROOT CAUSE:
The decline endpoint is checking if delivery.driver == current_driver,
but available orders have delivery.driver = None, so this check fails.

SOLUTION:
Update the decline action in your DeliveryViewSet to handle both:
- Available orders (driver=None) - most common case
- Assigned orders (driver=current_driver) - edge case

FILE TO UPDATE: delivery/views.py (or wherever your DeliveryViewSet is)

# ===== OPTIONAL: TRACK DECLINED ORDERS =====

# If you want to prevent declined orders from showing up again for the same driver,
# add this to your models.py:

class DeclinedDelivery(models.Model):
    """Track which deliveries have been declined by which drivers"""
    delivery = models.ForeignKey('Delivery', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    driver = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    declined_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['delivery', 'driver']

# Then update your available_orders action to filter out declined ones:

@action(detail=False, methods=['get'])
def available_orders(self, request):
    """Get available orders, excluding ones this driver declined"""
    driver = request.user
    
    # Get declined delivery IDs for this driver
    declined_ids = DeclinedDelivery.objects.filter(
        driver=driver
    ).values_list('delivery_id', flat=True)
    
    # Filter available orders
    deliveries = self.get_queryset().filter(
        driver__isnull=True,
        status=DeliveryStatus.ASSIGNED.value
    ).exclude(
        id__in=declined_ids  # Exclude declined ones
    )
    
    serializer = self.get_serializer(deliveries, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data)

# ===== TESTING THE FIX =====

# After implementing, test with:
# 1. Create an order with no driver assigned
# 2. Try to decline it from the mobile app
# 3. Should succeed without "you can only decline" error
# 4. Order should disappear from that driver's list
