## Issue 3: Missing expo-font Package

### Issue Description
The application was encountering the following error:
```
Error: Unable to resolve module expo-font from /Users/abdallah/Documents/mursal/DriverAppNew/node_modules/@expo/vector-icons/build/createIconSet.js: expo-font could not be found within the project or in these directories:
  node_modules
> 1 | import * as Font from "expo-font";
    |                        ^
```

This error occurred because the `@expo/vector-icons` package depends on `expo-font` for loading icon fonts, but this dependency was not installed in the project.

### Solution Implemented
1. Updated the `expo-font` package version in the dependencies in `package.json` from "^11.4.0" to "^11.10.2":
   ```json
   "expo-font": "^11.10.2"
   ```

2. Updated the README.md file with instructions for installing the package:
   - Added a new section under "Troubleshooting > Missing Packages" with instructions to run `npm install` or `yarn install`
   - Explained that this package is required by @expo/vector-icons for font loading functionality
   - Added instructions for cleaning the Metro bundler cache and rebuilding the project if issues persist after installing dependencies

### Technical Details
- The `expo-font` package is a dependency of `@expo/vector-icons` and is used to load custom fonts, including icon fonts.
- Version 11.10.2 has been specified, which is compatible with the other Expo packages used in this project.
- This package is imported by the createIconSet.js file in the @expo/vector-icons package, which is used to create the icon components like Ionicons.
- The issue was that despite having the package in package.json, the Metro bundler was not able to resolve the module, possibly due to cache issues or incompatible versions.
- Updating the package version and cleaning the Metro bundler cache should resolve the issue.
