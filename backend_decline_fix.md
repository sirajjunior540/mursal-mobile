# Backend Decline API Fix

## üö® Current Problem

The backend decline endpoint is rejecting requests with:
```
"You can only decline your own assigned deliveries."
```

This is incorrect logic for a delivery app. The error shows the backend expects:
- Order must be already assigned to the current driver
- Only then can the driver decline it

## ‚úÖ Correct Behavior

Drivers should be able to decline:
1. **Available orders** (not yet assigned to anyone) - PRIMARY USE CASE
2. **Orders assigned to them** (edge case for after acceptance)

## üõ†Ô∏è Django Backend Fix Required

### Current (Broken) Logic:
```python
# In delivery ViewSet decline action
def decline(self, request, pk=None):
    delivery = self.get_object()
    
    # ‚ùå WRONG: Only allows declining own assigned deliveries
    if delivery.driver != request.user.driver:
        return Response(
            {"error": "You can only decline your own assigned deliveries."}, 
            status=400
        )
    # ... rest of logic
```

### Fixed Logic:
```python
# In delivery ViewSet decline action
def decline(self, request, pk=None):
    delivery = self.get_object()
    current_driver = request.user.driver
    
    # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Allow declining available OR own assigned deliveries
    if delivery.driver is not None and delivery.driver != current_driver:
        return Response(
            {"error": "This delivery is already assigned to another driver."}, 
            status=400
        )
    
    # Case 1: Declining available delivery (driver=null)
    if delivery.driver is None:
        # Track the decline for this driver
        DriverOrderInteraction.objects.update_or_create(
            driver=current_driver,
            delivery=delivery,
            defaults={'action': 'declined'}
        )
        
        return Response({
            "message": "Delivery declined. It will no longer appear in your available orders."
        })
    
    # Case 2: Declining own assigned delivery (rare case)
    if delivery.driver == current_driver:
        # Unassign the delivery and mark as declined
        delivery.driver = None
        delivery.status = 'pending'  # Back to available pool
        delivery.save()
        
        # Track the decline
        DriverOrderInteraction.objects.update_or_create(
            driver=current_driver,
            delivery=delivery,
            defaults={'action': 'declined'}
        )
        
        return Response({
            "message": "Delivery unassigned and declined."
        })
```

## üìã Additional Backend Requirements

### 1. DriverOrderInteraction Model
```python
class DriverOrderInteraction(models.Model):
    driver = models.ForeignKey(Driver, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    delivery = models.ForeignKey(Delivery, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    action = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[
        ('viewed', 'Viewed'),
        ('declined', 'Declined'),
        ('accepted', 'Accepted'),
    ])
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['driver', 'delivery']
```

### 2. Updated available_orders Endpoint
```python
def available_orders(self, request):
    current_driver = request.user.driver
    
    # Get unassigned deliveries
    available_deliveries = Delivery.objects.filter(
        driver__isnull=True,
        status='pending'
    )
    
    # Exclude deliveries this driver has declined
    declined_ids = DriverOrderInteraction.objects.filter(
        driver=current_driver,
        action='declined'
    ).values_list('delivery_id', flat=True)
    
    available_deliveries = available_deliveries.exclude(id__in=declined_ids)
    
    serializer = self.get_serializer(available_deliveries, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data)
```

## üîß Quick Backend Test

### Test the Current Behavior:
```bash
# 1. Get available orders
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Host: sirajjunior.192.168.0.191" \
     http://192.168.0.191:8000/api/v1/delivery/deliveries/available_orders/

# 2. Try to decline an available order (currently fails)
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Host: sirajjunior.192.168.0.191" \
     http://192.168.0.191:8000/api/v1/delivery/deliveries/19/decline/
```

### Expected Response After Fix:
```json
{
    "message": "Delivery declined. It will no longer appear in your available orders."
}
```

## üéØ Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix the decline permission logic
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add DriverOrderInteraction tracking
3. **LOW PRIORITY**: Update available_orders to exclude declined

The minimum fix is to change the permission check in the decline endpoint to allow declining unassigned deliveries.

## üß™ Frontend Testing After Fix

Once the backend is fixed, test:
1. ‚úÖ Driver can decline available orders
2. ‚úÖ Declined orders disappear from that driver's list
3. ‚úÖ Other drivers still see the same orders
4. ‚úÖ Driver can accept other available orders normally

The current frontend implementation will work correctly once the backend allows declining unassigned deliveries.
