# Push Notifications Setup Guide

## Current Status
The app currently uses a simplified notification service that relies on built-in React Native APIs (Alert and Vibration). For full push notification functionality, additional libraries need to be installed.

## Required Libraries for Full Push Notification Support

### 1. React Native Push Notification
```bash
npm install react-native-push-notification
# For iOS
cd ios && pod install
```

### 2. React Native Sound
```bash
npm install react-native-sound
# For iOS
cd ios && pod install
```

### 3. Firebase Cloud Messaging (Recommended for production)
```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/messaging
# For iOS
cd ios && pod install
```

## Setup Steps (Future Implementation)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install react-native-push-notification react-native-sound @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/messaging
```

### 2. iOS Configuration
- Add notification permissions to `ios/DriverAppNew/Info.plist`
- Configure push notification capabilities in Xcode
- Add Firebase configuration file `GoogleService-Info.plist`

### 3. Android Configuration
- Add Firebase configuration file `google-services.json`
- Update `android/app/build.gradle` with Firebase plugin
- Configure notification channels for Android 8+

### 4. Update NotificationService
Replace the current simplified implementation with full featured service that includes:
- Real push notifications
- Background notification handling
- Custom notification sounds
- Notification actions (Accept/Decline)
- FCM token management

## Current Features (Working)
✅ Vibration patterns for order notifications
✅ In-app alerts for order notifications  
✅ Basic notification callbacks
✅ Test notification functionality
✅ Multiple vibration types (light, medium, strong)

## Features Requiring Library Installation
❌ Push notifications when app is in background
❌ Custom notification sounds
❌ Notification action buttons
❌ FCM token registration
❌ Silent notifications
❌ Scheduled notifications

## Development Note
The current implementation is sufficient for development and testing. For production deployment, implement the full push notification setup above.
